# UI Redesign Key Decisions

## Layout Centering Improvements

### Decision: Center All Layout Elements

**Date**: August 2, 2025
**Reason**: User requested to "center up layout" for better visual balance

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Main Layout Centering

- **App Main**: Added `justify-content: center` to center the entire layout grid
- **App Layout**: Added `max-width: 1200px` and `width: 100%` for consistent centering
- **Result**: The entire application layout is now properly centered on the page

#### 2. Content Area Centering

- **Check Editor Area**: Added `align-items: center` to center content vertically and horizontally
- **Editor Intro**: Added `max-width: 600px` to prevent text from being too wide
- **Check Container**: Added `align-items: center` and `max-width: 900px` for optimal check display

#### 3. Responsive Centering

- **Mobile Layout**: Added `justify-items: center` for grid centering on smaller screens
- **Sidebar**: Added `max-width: 600px` to prevent sidebar from being too wide
- **Content Width**: Ensured all content has appropriate max-widths for readability

#### 4. Header Centering

- **Header Content**: Added `width: 100%` to ensure proper header layout centering

### Design Rationale:

#### Visual Balance

- Centered layouts provide better visual balance and professionalism
- Prevents content from appearing "stuck" to one side of the screen
- Creates a more polished, intentional design

#### User Experience

- Centered content is easier to scan and read
- Reduces eye strain on wider screens
- Provides consistent experience across different screen sizes

#### Content Hierarchy

- Centering emphasizes the importance of the check editor
- Creates clear focus on the main interaction area
- Maintains proper spacing and breathing room around content

### Technical Implementation:

- Used CSS Grid and Flexbox centering techniques
- Implemented max-width constraints for optimal readability
- Maintained responsive behavior with centered layouts
- Preserved all existing functionality while improving visual presentation

### Result:

The application now has a perfectly centered, balanced layout that looks professional and intentional across all screen sizes, providing an improved user experience and visual appeal.
