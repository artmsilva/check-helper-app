# Application Simplification Task

**Date:** August 4, 2025  
**Objective:** Reduce lines of code and complexity for entire check helper application

## Goals

1. **Minimize Code**: Reduce total lines of code by 50%+
2. **Simplify Architecture**: Focus only on the essential check UI
3. **Remove Complexity**: Eliminate unnecessary features and UI elements
4. **Think Small**: Distill to core functionality - just the check interface

## Current State Analysis

### Current Components

- `check-form.js` - Complex form with sidebar, instructions, navigation
- `check-preview.js` - Interactive check editor (core functionality)
- `main.js` - Application bootstrapping
- `convertNumberToWords.js` - Amount conversion utility
- `styles.css` - Layered CSS with extensive UI elements

### Current Features

- Full app layout with header, sidebar, navigation
- Instructions and tips section
- Multiple navigation buttons (print, clear, help)
- Complex responsive design
- Extensive styling system

## Simplification Strategy

1. **Single File Approach**: Combine all JavaScript into one file
2. **Inline Check Only**: Remove all UI chrome, focus on check preview
3. **Minimal CSS**: Strip down to essential check styling only
4. **Remove Features**: Eliminate sidebar, navigation, instructions
5. **Direct Interaction**: Just the interactive check, nothing else

## Target Architecture

```
public/
├── index.html (minimal)
├── check.js (everything in one file)
└── check.css (minimal check styling)
```

## Success Metrics

- Reduce from ~800+ lines to <200 lines total
- Single interactive check component
- No extraneous UI elements
- Maintain core functionality: editable check fields, amount conversion
