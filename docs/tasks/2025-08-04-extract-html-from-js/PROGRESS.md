# Progress Log

## 2025-08-04 - Task Start

- **13:XX** - Created task directory and README
- **13:XX** - Analyzed current `index.html` structure (has `<div id="check"></div>` placeholder)
- **13:XX** - Identified HTML template in `app.js` `initCheck()` function
- **13:XX** - Plan: Extract HTML from JavaScript, place in HTML, modify JS to enhance existing DOM

## 2025-08-04 - Implementation

- **13:XX** - Extracted complete HTML structure from `app.js` and placed in `index.html`
- **13:XX** - Preserved all CSS classes and structure exactly as they were
- **13:XX** - Modified `initCheck()` function to work with existing DOM instead of generating it
- **13:XX** - Removed `container.innerHTML = ...` and kept only field enhancement logic
- **13:XX** - Task completed - check structure now visible immediately on page load

## 2025-08-04 - Phase 2: Further JS Reduction

- **13:XX** - User requested further JS reduction
- **13:XX** - Analyzing opportunities to simplify:
  1. Use native `contenteditable` without JavaScript field creation
  2. Simplify event handling with event delegation
  3. Use CSS for placeholder styling instead of JS class manipulation
  4. Reduce amount-to-words conversion complexity
  5. Use HTML data attributes for simpler data management
- **13:XX** - MAJOR REDUCTION COMPLETED:
  - Made all fields directly editable in HTML with `contenteditable="true"`
  - Added styling and placeholders directly in HTML
  - Replaced complex field creation system with simple event delegation
  - Eliminated `checkData` object and `createField()` function
  - Simplified amount-to-words conversion algorithm
  - Removed `initCheck()` function entirely
  - Reduced JS from ~180 lines to ~60 lines (66% reduction!)

## 2025-08-04 - Phase 3: CSS Reduction

- **13:XX** - User requested CSS reduction similar to JS reduction
- **13:XX** - Analyzed CSS usage in HTML:
  - Many atomic classes are unused (c-accent, c-bg, bg-focus only used by JS)
  - Can consolidate related classes (f-12, f-14, f-16 â†’ font-size utility)
  - Remove unused positioning, width, and layout classes
  - Combine field styling into semantic classes
  - Target: 50%+ CSS reduction while maintaining functionality
- **13:XX** - MASSIVE CSS REDUCTION COMPLETED:
  - Eliminated 30+ unused atomic classes
  - Consolidated typography, spacing, and layout into semantic classes
  - Combined all field styling into single `[contenteditable]` selector
  - Simplified HTML class usage (removed 15+ classes per field)
  - Reduced CSS from ~175 lines to ~60 lines (65% reduction!)
  - Updated JavaScript to use simplified class structure
  - Maintained all visual appearance and functionality
