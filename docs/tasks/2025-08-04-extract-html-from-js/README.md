# Extract HTML from JavaScript to HTML File

## Objective

Extract the check HTML template from `app.js` and put it directly into `index.html` so the check structure is available immediately on browser download, without requiring JavaScript to generate the DOM.

## Background

Currently, the check HTML structure is generated by JavaScript in the `initCheck()` function. This means:

- The page is blank until JavaScript runs
- No progressive enhancement
- Slower initial render

## Goal

Move the static HTML structure to `index.html` and modify JavaScript to only handle interactivity:

- Check structure visible immediately
- Faster perceived performance
- Better progressive enhancement
- JavaScript only adds editable functionality

## Files to Modify

- `public/index.html` - Add check HTML structure
- `public/src/app.js` - Remove HTML generation, focus on field enhancement

## Success Criteria

- Check structure visible on page load before JavaScript runs
- JavaScript still adds interactive editing functionality
- No visual or functional changes to end user experience
